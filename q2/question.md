# Question 2

Write a program that:

* Asks the user for their name.
* Asks the user to input their graduation year.
* Asks the user to input the current year.

Assume the student is in a four-year undergraduate program. Display the 
current status the student is in. Possible status include: not in college yet, 
freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, graduated.

Note: If graduation year equals to current year, status is ‘Graduated’; if 
graduation year is four years after current year, status is ‘Freshman’, etc.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the 
following example:

    Please enter your name: Jessica
    Please enter your graduation year: 2019
    Please enter current year: 2015
    Jessica, you are a Freshman
