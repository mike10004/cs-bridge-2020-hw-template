# Question 4

Define the following constants:

    const int FLOOR_ROUND = 1;
    const int CEILING_ROUND = 2;
    const int ROUND = 3;

Write a program that asks the user to enter a Real number, then it asks the user to enter the
method by which they want to round that number (floor, ceiling or to the nearest integer).
The program will then print the rounded result.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows in the following example:

    Please enter a Real number:
    4.78
    Choose your rounding method:
    1. Floor round
    2. Ceiling round
    3. Round to the nearest whole number
    2
    5

Implementation requirement: Use a switch statement.
